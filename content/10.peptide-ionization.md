## Peptide Ionization {.page_break_before}



The 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to partially to John Fenn and Koichi Tanaka "for their development of soft desorption ionisation methods for mass spectrometric analyses of biological macromolecules" [@URL:https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2002/summary/]. This breakthrough ushered in the era of mass spectrometry as an important tool for protein and peptide analysis. 

### MALDI
Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization(MALDI) is an ionization technique that uses a laser energy absorbing matrix to create ions from large molecules with minimal fragmentation. 





### Electrospray Ionization

Electrospray ionization relies on the formation of charged droplets releasing ions from the surface (ion evaporation model) or via complete solvent evaporation (charge residual model).
